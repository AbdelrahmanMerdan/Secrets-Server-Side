<h1> How it was built </h1>
The programs backend was built using JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, the web-based platform Railway app and GitHub Pages. JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. Node.js was used to build the backend logic of the website and connect it to the front-end using the web-based platform Railway app. I utilized Railway app to create and manage my own APIs, it made it simple to connect to data sources, create endpoints, and access the data from anywhere in the world. MongoDB was used to store the information sent by the user in a secure place where it can be accessed at any time. Finally , I used GitHub Pages to host the website. The full list of everything used is below:
<ul>
